The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: "1"
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "1211"

输入字符串
输出下一个字符串

输入
判断 栈为空或与栈顶元素相同 当前元素入栈
与栈顶元素不同 返回当前栈的长度以及数  栈清空 当前元素入栈
直到遍历完成
返回下一个字符串 以及n

进行迭代 直到达到给定的n
